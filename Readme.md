# Questionnaire

### Questionnaire
Our project for the hackathon is a website that integrates with Learning Management Systems (LMS)
to enhance them with a question generation feature. This feature leverages AI to create personalized 
and engaging questions for students based on course content and their learning history. It aims to 
address the limitations of traditional LMS, such as static content and limited interactivity, by providing 
dynamic and adaptive learning experiences. Our goal is to improve student engagement and learning outcomes 
while reducing the burden on teachers for creating and grading questions.
